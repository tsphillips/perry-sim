/**
Generate a StoryArc.

At any point in the sim, the player is faced with the choice of what to do.
A StoryArc guides the player through a story, told as a series of choices.
This structure is meant to be a departure from the traditional video game quest mechanic.

Lots of random notes follow. Thus far I am pulling from various sources to
dance around the issue of procedurally generated plot. I think I can distill
some primitives from the notes so resultant plots (and their characters) do
not seem so formulaic or off-the-shelf.

A StoryArc has:
- characters
- locations
- props
- plot
