# TODO

## Near-term

* Add button class that binds to arbitrary functions.
* Add blocking tiles. Probably something like even numbers are pass-through and odd numbers are blocking.
* Add target queue on Body. moveTo() will grab the next target in the queue after arriving at a target.
* Add pathfinding to moveTo().
* Add Zone class that references multiple Scene instances.
* Add portal locations to scenes, where a portal links to a zone:scene:position.

## Long-term

* Add EntityProxy class that is used by the Client classes. EntityProxy instances will sync with server.
