# TODO

## Near-term

* [Client] Add button class that binds to arbitrary functions.
* [Server] Add blocking tiles. Scene needs list of tile numbers that are passable, tile numbers that are blocking. May want to extend this to map tile numbers to functions.
* [Server] Add target queue on Body. moveTo() will grab the next target in the queue after arriving at a target.
* [Server] Add pathfinding to moveTo().
* [Server] Add Zone class that references multiple Scene instances.
* [Server] Add portal locations to scenes, where a portal links to a zone:scene:position.

## Long-term

* Add EntityProxy class that is used by the Client classes. EntityProxy instances will sync with server.
