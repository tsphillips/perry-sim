= TODO

* Consider http://mochajs.org/

Rethinking the backend.
May divide into:

* zone graph
* scene graph
* 2D map
* dialog system
* commerce system
* combat system
* agent system

Then the above systems can be combined for a world simulation.

For development: npm, babel, and webpack.

```
npm install babel babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react webpack lite-server --save-dev
```


== Hi-Pri

* Refactor build process to use webpack and babel.
* Refine and clarify project goals:
    ** deterministic scene graph
    ** procedural generation for scene graph
    ** isometric engine
    ** procedural generation for isometric map
    ** agent system
        *** navigate scene graph
        *** navigate isometric map
        *** interact with other agents
    ** dialog system (subsumed by agent interaction?)
    ** mod system for scene graph generation
    ** mod system for isometric graph generation
    ** mod system for agent behavior
    ** quest system
    ** procedural generation of quests

== Near-term

* [Client] Add button class that binds to arbitrary functions.
* [Server] Add blocking tiles. Scene needs list of tile numbers that are passable, tile numbers that are blocking. May want to extend this to map tile numbers to functions.
* [Server] Add target queue on Body. moveTo() will grab the next target in the queue after arriving at a target.
* [Server] Add pathfinding to moveTo().
* [Server] Add Zone class that references multiple Scene instances.
* [Server] Add portal locations to scenes, where a portal links to a zone:scene:position.

== Mid-term
* [Server] Procedurally generated maps, characters, objects, and stories.
* [Server] Combat system. See here: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/157upf/what_was_sword_fighting_actually_like_did_it/

== Long-term

* Add EntityProxy class that is used by the Client classes. EntityProxy instances will sync with server.
